# teaching

I plan to use this repo to consolidate all of my teaching materials. 

Navigate to the 'workshops' branch to see workshops I've hosted.

Navigate to the 'gh-pages' branch to see slides I've created, primarily for CS160 @ UCB, (or click <a href="https://cbannon35.github.io/teaching/" target="_blank">here</a>)
